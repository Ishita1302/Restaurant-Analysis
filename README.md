# Restaurant-Analysis
The restaurant industry is one such industry where competition has increased and at the same time, customers have become even more demanding.
With the onset of cloud kitchens, increasing investment from private equity and emergence of food delivery apps, the competition in the space has become fierce for all sorts of players in the market, be it full-service restaurant, quick service restaurant or a well-recognized chain. In such a scenario, data analytics can play an important role in creating a differentiating factor for a restaurant. Better knowledge of business, personalized customer experience, reduced wastage and pilferage and targeted marketing are some of the key areas where data analytics can help in either increasing revenue opportunities or reduce the expenses.
